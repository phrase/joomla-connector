## Phrase

[Phrase](https://www.phrase.com) is the translation management system for global companies wanting to improve 
localization efficiency. 400+ languages, 50+ file types, 25+ MT engines, REST API, and patented AI make Phrase 
the TMS used by many of the world’s leading brands to reduce costs, automate workflows, and optimize the entire 
translation process.

The Phrase extension for Joomla! allows you to connect your Joomla! account with Phrase to translate
articles and categories.

## Requirements

The Phrase extension for Joomla! is free, but you do need an Phrase account to use the extension. 
Please see our [pricing page](https://phrase.com/pricing/) for details. 
You will also need to be running **Joomla! 3.7 or newer**.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Memsource/joomla-connector/releases) page.
2. In Joomla, go to `Extensions` → `Manage` → `Install` and upload the downloaded package.

## Configuration

1. In Joomla, go to `Components` → `Phrase Connector`. On this page, you will see the URL and a token. The URL will 
be in the address bar, and the token can be found under the *Phrase Connector Token* heading. Save these — you’ll 
need these to configure Phrase.
2. In Phrase, go to `Setup` → `Integrations` → `Connectors` → `New`, fill in the form with your URL and Token from 
the previous step and click on `Test connection`. If everything is successful, `Save` the connector.
